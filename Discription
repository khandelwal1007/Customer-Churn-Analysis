# 📊 Teco Customer Churn Analysis

A data-driven project to understand customer churn patterns in the telecom industry and identify key factors affecting customer retention.

## Objective

To analyze customer behavior and determine how factors like **contract type**, **payment method**, and **tenure** impact churn rates, enabling strategic decisions to improve retention.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Others:** MS Excel (for initial data inspection & summaries)

## Key Insights

- **Contract Type:**  
  - Month-to-month contracts have a **42% churn rate**, compared to **11% (1-year)** and **3% (2-year)**.  
  - Long-term contracts help retain customers.

- **Payment Method:**  
  - **45% churn** seen in electronic check users.  
  - Other methods like credit cards & bank transfers show only **15–18% churn**.  
  - Promoting secure payment options can reduce churn.

- **Tenure Impact:**  
  - Customers in their **first year churn at 50%**.  
  - After 3 years, churn drops to just **15%**.  
  - Early engagement is critical.

- **Other Findings:**  
  - **Senior citizens** churn more (41%) than non-seniors (26%).  
  - **Fiber optic users** churn more than DSL users.

## Visualizations

- Bar charts, line graphs, and histograms were used to show churn distribution across:
  - Contract types
  - Payment methods
  - Tenure levels
  - Internet service types  
  - These visuals clearly highlight the risk areas for churn.
